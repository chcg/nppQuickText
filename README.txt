DESCRIPTION

    QuickText is a Notepad++ plugin for quick text substitution, including 
    multi field inputs. It's similar to Tab Triggers in TextMate.

BUILD

    I compiled with MS Visual Studio Community 2017 and this seems to work 
    OK.
    
    For 32-bit:
      [x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017]
      C:\> set Configuration=Release
      C:\> set Platform=x86
      C:\> msbuild
    
    For 64-bit:
      [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017]
      C:\> set Configuration=Release
      C:\> set Platform=x64
      C:\> msbuild

INSTALLATION

    Copy the:
    
    32-bit:
        ./bin/QuickText.dll
       
    64-bit:
        ./bin64/QuickText.dll

    to the Notepad++ plugins folder:
      - In N++ <7.6, directly in the plugins/ folder
      - In N++ >=7.6, in a directory called QuickText in the plugins/ folder
        (plugins/QuickText/)
    
    NOTE:  The original version put config files in weird places and with 
           no updated since the Notepad++ 7.6 new plugins architecture, it's 
           gotten worse.  This version corrects this.  You'll need to put 
           the following files in their respective directory locations:
           
           QuickText.conf.ini = NPP_INSTALL_DIR/plugins/Config
           QuickText.ini      = NPP_INSTALL_DIR/plugins/QuickText

USAGE

    Use the key shortcut to use QuickText tags from within the current 
    Notepad++ document.
    
CUSTOMIZATION

    To make you're own tags:
        - First make sure the tag's Language Section already exists. This is done by
        creating a new section with the code corresponding to the Language.
        (See LANGUAGE CODES).
        - Then, for the key of the tag, use only lower/upper case and numbers.
        - Special chars:
            - $ hotspots
            - \$ for writing actual '$'
            - \n break line.

    Or just use the Options GUI. (v0.2) :)
